	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p> Time complexity measures how an algorithmâ€™s runtime increases with input size. It helps assess efficiency, with common complexities like \( O(1) \) for constant time and \( O(n) \) for linear time. Understanding time complexity aids in optimizing algorithms for better performance. For efficient working and responsiveness one should optimize time complexity</p>
	<p> <b> Space complexity </b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of the input. It includes both the space required for input storage and additional space needed for computation. Common complexities include \( O(1) \) for constant space and \( O(n) \) for linear space. Analyzing space complexity is crucial for ensuring that algorithms do not exceed available memory resources.</p>
